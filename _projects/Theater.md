<p>The topic for this studio is to figure out how to get geometry involved in a theater design. And using panelization to resolve the irregular curve surfaces makes it easier to calculate and build in practice.</p>
<p>The site is in a small and quiet community in east Boston near the water. After site trip and interviews with the residents there, it seems like live performance nowadays seems to be too high art for people to appreciate compared to internet media.</p>
<p>After we come back we have been thinking about what can we do for them by doing a theater. Or do they really need a typical theater and professional drama? The answer may be no. Then the thoughts came to our mind: “Maybe it could be a park!” We decided to build a weird theater that opens to everyone, which is very different from a typical theater like this. These theaters have similar auditoriums surrounded by circulation and dressing rooms and then covered by a shell, a façade.</p>

    Surface Prototype combination Experiment

<p>The intention of creating openess made us choose this geometry prototype.</p>
To generate one surface, we need two spiral curves, loft them to get a surface, and then use a box to cut it. Then what happens is this surface can be copied and piled up in 3 dimensions. What feature does this kind of geometry have?

<p>First, it is endless, it won’t create any closed spaces that wrap around the theater. Also, due to the characteristics of the prototype, surfaces join the facade and floors, stairs naturally, which means the surfaces will make up not only the façade but also the whole building.</p>
The next thing we need to focus on is how to use panelization to resolve the geometry, forming the space in theater. We figured out two types of panelization that can be used in this project. In our project, two panelizations construct different functions. The first one is diamond panelization, this type has two uses, one is to build the surface outside and another one is to be transformed into boxes to inhabit people, for example, the café and boxes in the auditorium. Another type is the folded plane, which is used to form transportation spaces.

The auditorium is designed following the surface, spiraling up. At the bottom of the theater, we extracted the isocurves of the surface and used folded planes to create the way going up. For the upper half, since the isocurves begin to make the audience face outside and deconcentrated, we used diamond panels to make boxes to make people stay, and people get into boxes from the gaps which is the thickness created by two different panelized surfaces.

    Experimental Structure Model
</div>
<p>To make the structure strong enough to hold the building, straight-shaped beams are needed. It is better than those beams in polyline shape in terms of shear force. What is really nice about the surface is this prototype has straight isocurves that gather at one point although at different heights. We took this as structure. After the midterm, we merged some of those panels at the center with the beams in the same planer surface to hold different parts tighter. This structure system constrained us a lot but also provided us with opportunities.</p>
If we make all the creases and edges of surfaces aligned with structures, bounding tightly to the surface, the structure design can be coordinate with space form. Since both sides are using the same structural language, the building can keep a subtle balance itself. Once everything aligned up, the structure provided nice strength for our building.
