<p>Classrooms, the primary environment for pupils and junior high school students,have a significant impact on them. Among various factors, the lighting environment has a considerable influence on learning efficiency and health. In existing lighting standards in China, the evaluation is mostly conducted based on the overall lighting conditions in whole classrooms. However, there exist individual variations in lighting environments as different positions are scattered within the same classroom, which cannot be generalized.</p>

<p>Building upon previous studies on individual lighting environments evaluation, this paper simulates lighting conditions in standard classrooms model under the climate data</p>

<p>set of Linyi, Shandong Province, using the architectural environmental analysis plugin, Climate Studio. Different analysis methods and standards are employed to analyze the data obtained from the simulations.</p>

<p>The research yields two main contributions. Firstly, a new evaluation standard for classroom lighting environment is established. Secondly, the positive impact of the lighting environment on individuals is quantified through mathematical modelling. In addition, the obtained simulation data is used as an example to evaluate and demonstrate shading solutions.</p>

By focusing on individual lighting environments and considering local climatic conditions, this research provides insights into the assessment and improvement of classroom lighting. The proposed evaluation standard and quantitative analysis contribute to creating healthier and more conducive learning environments for students.
