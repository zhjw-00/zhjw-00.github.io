This project is part of Scene of Beijing 2, an urban data science book aimed at popularizing city data. It focuses on summarizing and visualizing 70 years of precipitation data in Beijing, analyzed from multiple dimensions such as time and space. The data was carefully visualized to illustrate both temporal trends and spatial distribution across the city, offering insights into how rainfall patterns have evolved. The final visual design helps communicate complex climate data in an accessible way, making it easier for readers to understand and reflect on the historical and future impacts of precipitation in Beijing.
