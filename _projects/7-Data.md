<p>As mechanical technology advances, artificial building environments must now allocate more space for machinery, shifting away from being exclusively human-centric. Balancing the relationship between human beings and machines and effectively organizing machines have become concerns for projects in highly developed cities.</p>

<p>Our design, an expansion of the New York Stock Exchange, aims to innovate spatial design to enhance value. The project explores a design methodology involving a grid-based approach for different components.</p>

<p>The entire building is divided into nine towers with structures holding the floors and servers which are organized as groups. Users can shuttle from tower to tower, in which 20% of space is for humans and 80% for servers. Access to the inner space of towers provides humans with possibilities for maintenance. Besides server systems and path systems for humans, the project also introduces cooling systems consisting of pipes, which take on the functions of air circulation.</p>

<p>Each tower is supported by a structure system. The system not only hold the floors and walls, but also hold the servers which is divided into groups. Each group has a core as a console, a controller for this group of servers.</p>

<p>Between these towers are the spaces for human activities, humans travel from tower to tower through the path. You can see gaps for human transportation from the view of section. And in some area, the access to the inside space of tower provides humans opportunities for maintenance. Besides structure system and circulation systems, we introduced cooling systems between the gap created by oblique walls and vertical servers, these pipes are inserted for heating exchange and air circulation, which extend to the facade.</p>

In terms of model fabrication, the structural logic of the model is consistent with that of the architectural design. The nine-tower structure is preserved, with 3D-printed components designed to interlock with the server stand based on these main structures. Structural connectors for the façade are retained on the exterior, allowing the primary framework to lift and support the façade, thus completing the overall model assembly.
