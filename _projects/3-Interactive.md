<p>Blind New World is a multi-player tangible interactive installation based on creating immersive environment and filtered information. Inspired by Aldous Huxley's novel, Brave New World, the installation simulates a society where the population is highly divided through information filtering. The novel depicts a society, the World State, where its citizens are produced and screened artificially, subtly shaped during their growth, and controlled by a soothing, happiness-producing drug called SOMA, in order to build a highly standardized world satisfying everyone without pain.</p>
<p>The colorful customized and personalized devices to enable everyone in the same environment to achieve diverse and unique multi-model information. This somehow reflects the society. Digital media seems to promise an abundance of knowledge, but most of the time, we are only told what we 'should'  know. Apps like TikTok and Instagram rely on algorithms and user data to deliver information that our brains are more inclined to know and like on each user's phone. However, we end up missing out on real and comprehensive information, which affects people's understanding of the world. This installation aims to create a similar experience to discuss similar social issues.</p>
<p>After entering the installation, users are assigned an identity. Upon identity verification, they receive different social background information (artificially cultivated). Then they enter society (a circular space), alternating between work and entertainment cycles. Different individuals have different work tasks, but everyone can exchange their work for SOMA, which allows them to enter the entertainment area to enjoy visual, auditory, and olfactory pleasures.</p>

<p>We built this installation from start to finish, including construction and virtual experience over the course of 8 weeks. The final outcomes were presented as a whole demo experience process, also we conducted a survey on users to investigate the influence of visual filtering on people's information understanding and acquisition.</p>
