<p>Welcome! I’m Jingwen Zhang, a researcher and designer exploring the intersection of design, computation, and urban systems. With a background in architecture, digital fabrication, and interaction design, I use computational modeling and data-driven analysis to understand how human behavior and environmental systems shape one another.</p>

My recent work focuses on developing computational frameworks that connect behavioral modeling, spatial analysis, and environmental simulation to support data-informed design and decision-making. I’m particularly interested in how digital tools can translate complex datasets into more intuitive, human-centered insights across architectural and urban scales.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
